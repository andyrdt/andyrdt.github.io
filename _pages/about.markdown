        I earned my bachelor's from Columbia University in 2018, where I studied computer science and mathematics.
        After graduating, I moved to Seattle to work as a software engineer at Microsoft.
        In 2020, I returned to Columbia University for my master's, focusing on theoretical computer science.
        During this period, I became interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">zero-knowledge cryptography</a>, and eventually went on to work for <a href="https://scroll.io">Scroll</a>, a startup applying this technology in the blockchain space.</p>
      <p>
        As of August 2023, I've shifted my focus towards <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/">AI interpretability</a>.
        Modern AI systems have become incredibly impressive, and yet their inner workings are still poorly understood.
        There is a lot of work to be done towards understanding the capabilities and limitations of these systems, and I want to try and contribute to this effort.

        I'm currently a PhD student at University of Chicago, where I am fortunate to be advised by Victor Veitch.

        Outside of work, I spend a lot of time across various hobbies.
        I love jazz music - I'm a decent tenor player, and a much worse piano player.
        Chess is a more recent hobby of mine, and I mostly play online.
        I like to run - I <a href="https://results.svetiming.com/Big-Sur/events/2023/Big-Sur-International-Marathon/3156/entrant/share">ran</a> my first marathon in April 2023.
        I'm a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenerbah%C3%A7e_S.K._(football)">Fenerbahçe</a> fan, and am currently learning Turkish.
