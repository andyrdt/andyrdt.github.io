I know with the great fall of UST, this post seems reactive. That's kind of true in that it sort of reinvigorated me to understand what the hell is going on, and to therefore write up some notes. But I wanted to write about stablecoins for a while. So here we go.

### What's a stablecoin?
Crypto assets are notoriously volatile. The most famous crypto asset is, of course, Bitcoin. Without smart contract functionality, Bitcoin was originally intended as a digital currency - a mechanism by which individual parties could transact with each other in a decentralized way. But the vision of Bitcoin being a widely accepted currency hasn't really caught on, and it's probably because Bitcoin, like almost all other crypto assets, is extremely volatile.

Here's a graph showing the volatility of Bitcoin over a two year period from May 2020 - May 2022:

Within just this two year period, the value of a Bitcoin swung from $10,000 up to $63,000, down to $30,000, up to $67,000, and back down to $28,000. That's called a roller coaster. A seller accepting Bitcoin payments would be signing up to ride this roller coaster (unless of course they immediately sell any Bitcoin they receive), and a lot of boomer sellers have motion sickness ðŸ¤¢.

An asset which aims to be used as a currency must not have such volatile value. A currency must have a relatively *stable* value. 

A **stablecoin** is a crypto asset that is designed to maintain a *stable* value.
