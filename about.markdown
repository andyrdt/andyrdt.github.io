        <p>Hi, I'm Andy.</p>
        <p>All I know is that I know nothing.</p>
        <p markdown="1">Hey, wait, that's a paradox: "that I know nothing" is itself something. And so then I would then know something, which is not nothing ðŸ¤”.</p>
        <p>One of the many things which I do not know is the purpose of this website. I am interested in far too many things: chess, music theory, cryptography, philosophy of mind, economics (just to name a few). I hope to use this website as a medium to document some of my explorations into these topics.</p>
